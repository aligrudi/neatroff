NEATROFF
========

Neatroff is an implementation of troff typesetting system in C
programming language.  Neatroff and its companion programs can be
obtained from http://litcave.rudi.ir/.

Neatroff:			git://repo.or.cz/neatroff.git
Postscript post-processor:	git://repo.or.cz/neatpost.git
Eqn pre-processor:		git://repo.or.cz/neateqn.git
Generating font descriptions:	git://repo.or.cz/neatmkfn.git
Top-level makefile and macros:	git://repo.or.cz/neatroff_make.git

Neatroff_make contains a set of standard macros and a top-level
makefile to obtain, build, and install neatroff and its pre- and
post-processors.  For compiling neatroff and neatpost manually, modify
FDIR and MDIR of their Makefiles to point the directories containing
the default output device and macros.
